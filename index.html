      I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior <br> knowledge in software development. However, within a few weeks, <br> I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also <br> master the soft skills required for being a software developer. <br>
    
    So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing <br> push in my career as a software developer. <br>

  </div>
 <div class="bothq">
  <div class="line1a">
    <h4> Why Is This Course Relevant Today?</h4> <br>
 There's never been a better time to start a career as a web developer because there <br> is a consistent demand for developers who both write high-quality code and <br> experienced problem solvers who can design creative solutions. <br> <br>
 
 The web and the applications built for it have transformed the way we do business <br> globally, and is disrupting industries from education to manufacturing. <br> <br>

 By the end of the course, you will have gained practice in the most used web-based <br> programming language – JavaScript. You’ll have built several full-stack applications <br> of varying complexity, and have experience working with a team in a development <br> environment. <br> <br>
 
 You’ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an ever-changing field. You’ll <br> have gained foundational skill in many disciplines that touch web development – <br> managing complex data sets, securing your applications with encrypted passwords, <br> and testing and deploying your applications to prepare them to scale. <br>
 
 <h4>Should I Come Equipped With Anything?</h4> 
 Yes, a laptop is required (either Mac or PC) with a minimum of 4GB RAM with a <br> storage capacity of at least 350GB. The course will walk you through installing the <br> necessary free software. <br> <br>
 
 At least, you’ll require basic secondary school mathematics, but no previous <br> programming language experience is required. <br>
   </div>
 <div class="line2a">

   By the end of this course, you’d have:
 
 <ul class="a5" >
   <li>Completed several individual and group projects</li>
   <li>Learned about web development from experienced web developers</li>
   <li>Networked with some of the best developers, companies, and entrepreneurs <br> in Lagos</li>
 <li>Prepared yourself with the foundational knowledge you need to begin a <br> career that embraces continuous learning</li>
 
 </ul>
 <h4>What Does Success In This Program Look Like?</h4> <br>

  To get the most out of this course, you have to be willing to fully immerse yourself <br> (get it?) in the classroom environment. This means actively engaging with your <br> instructors, classmates, and career coach, as well as taking every opportunity to <br> apply your new skills toward real-life projects. <br> <br>

We’ll help guide you through the entire process, but in order to succeed you’ll need <br> to completely commit to your work and continuously push yourself.
