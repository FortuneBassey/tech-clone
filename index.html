      I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior <br> knowledge in software development. However, within a few weeks, <br> I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also <br> master the soft skills required for being a software developer. <br>
    
    So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing <br> push in my career as a software developer. <br>
